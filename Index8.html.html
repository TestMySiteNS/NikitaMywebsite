<div class="container" id="welcome">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Welcome to this website about understanding children’s needs, safety, wellbeing, diversity, and how we support them in various environments. This includes exploring economic, social, cultural, health, crisis, and emergency contexts.</p>
</div>

<div class="container" id="economic">
  <h1>Economic</h1>
  <p>Children today grow up in a world influenced by economic conditions that affect their education, healthcare, nutrition, and overall wellbeing. Economic stability helps families provide safe homes, healthy meals, and learning opportunities. Poverty, however, can limit access to essential resources, impacting a child’s development.</p>
  <p>Understanding these economic influences allows support workers and educators to respond with awareness and compassion.</p>
</div>

<div class="container" id="social">
  <h1>Social</h1>
  <p>Social environments shape children’s behaviour, emotional growth, and sense of belonging. Positive social settings promote confidence, communication, and learning. Children thrive when surrounded by supportive families, peers, and communities.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Healthy friendships support emotional development.</li>
    <li>Community involvement helps children learn values and responsibility.</li>
    <li>Safe social spaces prevent bullying and social isolation.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="container" id="cultural">
  <h1>Cultural & Diversity</h1>
  <p>Cultural background influences how children see the world. Diversity includes language, traditions, beliefs, identity, and experiences. Respecting diversity helps children feel valued and understood.</p>
  <p>Educators and caregivers must provide culturally safe environments by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Respecting cultural practices.</li>
    <li>Encouraging children to express their identity.</li>
    <li>Challenging stereotypes and discrimination.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="container" id="health">
  <h1>Health & Wellbeing</h1>
  <p>Children’s physical and mental health is shaped by nutrition, exercise, hygiene, emotional support, and access to medical care. Supporting wellbeing includes promoting healthy habits and creating safe spaces for children to express feelings.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Healthy eating supports growth and learning.</li>
    <li>Regular activity prevents obesity and builds confidence.</li>
    <li>Emotional wellbeing helps children manage stress and build resilience.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="container" id="crisis">
  <h1>Crisis & Emergency</h1>
  <p>Children may experience emergencies such as natural disasters, accidents, family issues, or health crises. Support workers must be prepared to respond calmly and protect the child’s safety and emotional wellbeing.</p>
  <p>Key responsibilities include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Following emergency procedures.</li>
    <li>Providing reassurance and comfort.</li>
    <li>Reporting incidents accurately.</li>
    <li>Ensuring quick access to help when needed.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="container" id="reflect">
  <h1>Reflecting on Diversity & Evolving</h1>
  <p>Working with children requires continuous reflection and learning. Understanding diversity helps professionals adapt their practice to meet every child’s needs.</p>
  <p>Reflection allows educators to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify areas for improvement.</li>
    <li>Challenge personal biases.</li>
    <li>Provide culturally safe and responsive care.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
